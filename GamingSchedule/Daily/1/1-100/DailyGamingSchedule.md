# Monthly schedule

The new monthly schedule is for games that shouldn't be played very often. The first game to be added to this is Idle Miner Tycoon, as it was taking up too much time every Tuesday

## Notes

<details open><summary><p>Click/tap here to expand/collapse this section</p></summary>

Gameplay is photographed as part of my journaling project, and for stock imagery. Ads are photographed too.

I originally played on a Samsung Galaxy S7 edge from 2016 to November 12th 2020. As of November 13th 2020, I began transitioning gameplay away from the old S7 edge to a new Samsung Galaxy S20 FE I got on November 12th 2020. I really like the phone, there is only 1 part of it I consider a downgrade, which is that I went from a screen resolution of 2560x1440 (horizontal, 1440p) 1440x2560 (vertical, 1440p) to 2000x1080 (horizontal, 1080p) 1080x2000 (vertical, 1080p) the only game I still actively play on my old phone is Jewels, because it isn't compatible with Android 10.0, and I want to max out my score on it before abandoning my old S7 edge

## Under consideration

<details open><summary><p>Click/tap here to expand/collapse this section</p></summary>

* It is under consideration if I will resume playing Tiny Tower in 2021 or not. On January 27th 2021, my phone was auto-updated to Android 11. Tiny Tower kept crashing upon trying to play, and I lost my 620+ consecutive day streak. Accidentally a few days later, I found the game worked again, but didn't feel like playing due to my lost progress. I am still trying to gain interest to play again.

> As of March 24th 2021, I have not resumed gameplay. On February 17th 2021, this status post was shortened to save memory. See previous entries for more info.

> I have been starting to consider playing at night again, but at the moment, I am happy to have no major tasks to do after I wrap up GitHub work for the night.

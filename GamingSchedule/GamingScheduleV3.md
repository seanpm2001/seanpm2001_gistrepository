# New gaming schedule (weekly)

On Saturday, October 24th 2020, I had to set a schedule to limit my gaming. I went on a hiatus that lasted over half the month, and returning into things, I am already overloaded at 60%
I have decided to split non-daily games into time slots on certain days. My new limit is 2.5-4.5 hours of gaming a day, 1 hour limit on shooting games (included into total)

## Limitations

On Thursday, November 5th 2020, I discovered that all 6 storm8 games no longer let me cheat and have infinite duration on items produced. It glitched out a couple times and let items be preserved for over 2 weeks without paying extra. This doesn't seem to work anymore, and now the sessions are being operated differently.

> Minor update from November 19th 2020: this issue no longer applies to Farm Story (unless the 4 day crop expires before the 8 day point) but I have gotten used to gameplay like this.

## Notes

Gameplay is photographed as part of my journaling project, and for stock imagery. Ads are photographed too.

I originally played on a Samsung Galaxy S7 edge from 2016 to November 12th 2020. As of November 13th 2020, I began transitioning gameplay away from the old S7 edge to a new Samsung Galaxy S20 FE I got on November 12th 2020. I really like the phone, there is only 1 part of it I consider a downgrade, which is that I went from a screen resolution of 2560x1440 (horizontal, 1440p) 1440x2560 (vertical, 1440p) to 2000x1080 (horizontal, 1080p) 1080x2000 (vertical, 1080p) the only game I still actively play on my old phone is Jewels, because it isn't compatible with Android 10.0, and I want to max out my score on it before abandoning my old S7 edge

## Under consideration

It is under consideration that Lego Tower gameplay should be moved to Wednesday, as Thursday already has 6 games set. It takes me all the way down to 13% battery to successfully play all 7 games under a new style. The con of this is that Wednesday (alonh with Friday) is a lax day, with 3 required games instead of 4. I am unsure if I want to get rid of my only free day.

# New gaming schedule (weekly)

On Saturday, October 24th 2020, I had to set a schedule to limit my gaming. I went on a hiatus that lasted over half the month, and returning into things, I am already overloaded at 60%
I have decided to split non-daily games into time slots on certain days. My new limit is 2.5-4.5 hours of gaming a day, 1 hour limit on shooting games (included into total)

## Limitations

On Thursday, November 5th 2020, I discovered that all 6 storm8 games no longer let me cheat and have infinite duration on items produced. It glitched out a couple times and let items be preserved for over 2 weeks without paying extra. This doesn't seem to work anymore, and now the sessions are being operated differently.

## Under consideration

It is under consideration that Lego Tower gameplay should be moved to Wednesday, as Thursday already has 6 games set. It takes me all the way down to 13% battery to successfully play all 7 games under a new style. The con of this is that Wednesday is a lax day, with 3 required games instead of 4. I am unsure if I want to get rid of my only free day.

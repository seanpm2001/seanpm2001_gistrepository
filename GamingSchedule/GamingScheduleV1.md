# New gaming schedule (weekly)

On Saturday, October 24th 2020, I had to set a schedule to limit my gaming. I went on a hiatus that lasted over half the month, and returning into things, I am already overloaded at 60%
I have decided to split non-daily games into time slots on certain days. My new limit is 2.5-4.5 hours of gaming a day, 1 hour limit on shooting games (included into total)

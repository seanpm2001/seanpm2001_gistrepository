# Organization description

My organization for health projects. I am committed to promoting open source, functional, and life saving medical software.

**The part that was cut off:**

Legal notice: due to Red Cross logo restrictions, I used the Swiss (🇨🇭 Switzerland) flag instead. The Red Cross/Red Crescent movement is known to be abusive when it come to their logo (which is just an inverted version of the flag of 🇨🇭 Switzerland, or 🇹🇷 Turkey. Other than that, the Red Cross/crescent movement is good) Also: my health software is designed to help, but it isn't 100% accurate and isn't a 100% guarantee in saving a life.
